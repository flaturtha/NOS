# Cursor AI Agent Prompt: Build New Decoy Offer Landing Page Components

## Overview
Create NEW components for a Hormozi-style decoy offer landing page for the Bradys mystery collection. DO NOT overwrite existing components - create all new files with "_v2" suffix so I can cherry-pick content from the old versions later.

## Design Principles
1. Keep existing site layout structure and color scheme from current NOS repo
2. Mobile-first design (97% of users are 65+ on mobile devices)
3. Follow Alex Hormozi decoy offer best practices:
   - Side-by-side presentation on desktop
