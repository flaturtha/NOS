## Design Principles Followed

### Hormozi Decoy Offer Best Practices
‚úÖ Side-by-side presentation on desktop  
‚úÖ Equal visual weight for both options in hero  
‚úÖ Premium option (collection) positioned first/left on desktop, top on mobile  
‚úÖ Clear asymmetric dominance in comparison section  
‚úÖ Decoy clearly inferior on decisive attributes  

### Mobile-First Design
‚úÖ 97% of users are 65+ on mobile devices  
‚úÖ Button min-height: 56px for easier tapping  
‚úÖ Generous spacing and readable text  
‚úÖ Stacked layout on mobile with collection on top  

### Existing Site Integration
‚úÖ Maintains existing color scheme and fonts  
‚úÖ Uses existing ad variant system  
‚úÖ Integrates with existing hooks and modals  
‚úÖ Preserves existing layout structure  

## Technical Implementation

### File Naming
- All components end with "_v2" suffix
- No existing files overwritten
- Easy to cherry-pick content later

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Desktop: Side-by-side layouts where appropriate
- Mobile: Stacked layouts with collection prioritized
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Button Styling
- **Hero Section**: Equal weight, same height (min 56px)
- **Comparison Section**: Hierarchy (secondary vs primary)
- **Final CTA**: Clear size difference (20% larger for collection)

### Color Usage
- Yellow box: Existing yellow/amber
- Primary CTA: Existing red-600
- Secondary CTA: Existing gray-600
- Badges: Yellow-400 for "BEST VALUE", red-600 for "MOST POPULAR"

## Usage

### Access the New Landing Pages
- URLs: `/31tbe`, `/32tbe`, `/31bte`, `/32bte`, `/37tbe`

- All routes now feature the Hormozi-style decoy offer layout

### Integration Points
- Uses existing GHL form modal

3. **A/B Test**: Compare against existing landing page
4. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates for both options
5. **Copy Refinement**: Adjust copy based on performance data
