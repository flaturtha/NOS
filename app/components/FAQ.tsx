              Do I need a Kindle to read these?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              No. Every book comes in both Kindle (MOBI/AZW3) and ePub formats. That means you can read them on Kindle, Kobo, Nook, iPad, or any other device. And move them when you change!

              Are these the full books?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes. These are complete, standalone novels — not samples, not excerpts. Each story was originally published as a full BRADY'S SECRET SERVICE DETECTIVE dime novel.

              What if I lose the files?

              No problem. Your download links remain active, and you can always request a resend. I want you to feel secure knowing your books are yours to keep forever. Bookfunnel will always have your download links available.

              Can I share them with my spouse or friend?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes. These are DRM-free. You can back them up, copy them to multiple devices, and share within your household. In fact, I encourage that … the more people that read these great books, the more we honor their authors!
